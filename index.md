## About

I am fourth year PhD Candidate in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a bachelor's degree in Climate & Meteorology with minors in Computer Science and Latin from the University of Michigan. I study the influence of the wind on Arctic warming and sea ice loss.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy being in the Colorado outdoors running, biking, and hiking. I also like reading sci-fi and fantasy books, cooking, drawing, and doing puzzles.
