## Research
### Arctic Cloud Optics Project
In this research project, I evaulated whether improving supercooled liquid cloud optics affects radiation emitted from Arctic clouds using a hierarchy of models. I also developed a process for evaluating the effect of a physics change across a range of model types and scales. This paper for this project is in review at Geoscientific Model Development and is available as a [preprint](
https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2043). The most recent presentation of this project was a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/6ECGPNW9Ufw?si=gjIZCSEgPW2tJzXp&t=18708) at the CESM Workshop in June 2024.

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NASA PREFIRE grant.

### Controls on Arctic Warming Project
In this project, I determined how much of the observed Arctic warming and sea loss and variability we can attribute to changes in the winds and sea ice mean state. The most recent presentation of this project was a [poster](/assets/pdfs/AGU2024_Poster.pdf) at the annual AGU meeting in December 2024.

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Arctic Natural Sciences grant.
