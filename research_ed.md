## Research
### Arctic Cloud Optics Project
In this research project, I evaulated whether improving supercooled liquid cloud optics affects radiation emitted from Arctic clouds using a hierarchy of models. I also developed a process for evaluating the effect of a physics change across a range of model types and scales. The most recent presentation of this project was a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/6ECGPNW9Ufw?si=gjIZCSEgPW2tJzXp&t=18708) at the CESM Workshop in June 2024. The first-author paper for this project has been published at _Geoscientific Model Development_ ([https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-7185-2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-7185-2025)).

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NASA PREFIRE grant.

### Controls on Arctic Warming and Sea Ice Loss Project
In this project, I determined how much of the observed Arctic warming and sea loss and variability we can attribute to changes in the winds and sea ice mean state. The most recent presentation of this project was a [talk](https://cuboulder.zoom.us/rec/share/GsEv5-hrM2P29wCBbPzR3LT3FX5Ml_Ks_X-zGRzsZDWTkHmWh9cGQwsMa7n3TFaV.PqEq_PwvXoI2MHll)[Passcode: @9G%$qTA] at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Colloquium in September 2025. The first-author paper for this project is in press at _Environmental Research: Climate_ ([https://doi.org/10.1088/2752-5295/ae11cb](https://doi.org/10.1088/2752-5295/ae11cb)).

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Arctic Natural Sciences grant.
